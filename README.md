The ticket reservation system for the "F1 Grand Prix De Monaco 2024" event is developed using ASP.NET Core for the backend and Entity Framework Core for database operations. The system uses a relational database with models and migrations handled via Entity Framework. The frontend is built with React, and Axios is used for connecting the frontend to the backend via RESTful APIs.

All validations are implemented on both the frontend and backend to ensure security and reduce unnecessary requests to the server.
